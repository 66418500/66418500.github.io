<mjg59> Damnit. I've got a month to write a paper. This involves
        actually writing the chunks of code I'm going to be talking
        about.
<asuffield> find a bunch of students and give it to them as an exercise
<mjg59> asuffield: I'm surrounded by a bunch of students. Last time I
        let them touch code, I came back and found they'd rewritten
        all the C++ code in C and all the C code in C++
<asuffield> mwahaha
<mjg59> AND BROKE THE BUILD
